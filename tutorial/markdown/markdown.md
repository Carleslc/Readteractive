You can use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax for styling your chapters. This README file is written entirely in Markdown.

Markdown is simpler than HTML, but if you need to use it, Markdown supports HTML tags.

The example chapter `start.md` provides very useful examples using Markdown.

In order to improve your writting even more you can use a Markdown highlight editor. There are many Markdown editors, some are online like [this](https://stackedit.io/) or [this](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/), and other are desktop applications like [Typeora](https://typora.io/). Code editors like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) have markdown plugins too ([Atom package](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview), [Sublime Text 3 package](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing)).

When you build your book, Readteractive will make HTML, PDF and EPUB versions using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
Pandoc allows you to do a few more things besides. You can read more about that in the [Pandoc Manual](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).
