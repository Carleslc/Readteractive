A [gamebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook) is a work of printed fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making choices. Gamebooks have been influenced by [_Choose Your Own Adventure_ Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) and tabletop role-playing games.

Production of new gamebooks in the West decreased dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away from print based media, although the format may be getting a new lease of life on mobile and ebook platforms. Such digital gamebooks are considered [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction).

This tutorial is built with Readteractive, so of course this is one interactive book.
