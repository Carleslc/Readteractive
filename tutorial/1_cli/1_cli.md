A [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html) generator for scaffolding [Readteractive](https://github.com/Carleslc/Readteractive) books.

We provide a _command line interface_ to easily generate your project doing **scaffolding**, so you don't need to remember the syntax of each file and you can just **focus on writing**.

The (Readteractive structure -> [structure]) and files can be automatically generated using this CLI for your custom book.

It also provides a tool for **visualization** of your book with current chapters and the links between them, so you can have a general overview of the **narrative branches** of your book.

Choose an option:

- (Readteractive Structure -> [structure])
- (Return back -> [getting-started])
