[![CLI repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI-readteractive--generator-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Carleslc/readteractive-generator)

We provide a _command line interface_ to easily generate your project doing **scaffolding**, so you don't need to remember the syntax of each file and you can just **focus on writing**.

It also provides a tool for **visualization** of your book with current chapters and the links between them, so you can have a general overview of the **narrative branches** of your book.
